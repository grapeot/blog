After moving the compiler implementation of our [Beamer Writer](http://lab.grapeot.me/beamer/) to node.js, we are able to provide more features than our old version (which used the client javascript).

One of them is directly exporting (as well as compiling) the LaTeX code on [writelatex.com](http://writelatex.com/).
The usage is straightforward.
Like before, after writing the outline, click the `generate` button to get the LaTeX code in the output textbox.
If you wish to further edit/compile/collaborate with others online, click the `export to writelatex.com` button.
And Beamer Writer will redirect you to writelatex.com, a website provides cross-device real-time editing, compiling and collaboration services.
Of course, manual copy/paste to your favorite editor without involving cloud LaTeX services is always an option.

We hope beamer means a efficient and light-weight presentation tool for you. 
Enjoy.
