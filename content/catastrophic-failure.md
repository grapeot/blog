I have been a happy user of DigitalOcean for more than 5 years now. But got two accidents in the past month. One for the machine being powered down for no reason. Talked with the support but we couldn't find anything, no operations from DO backend, also no log from OS side... The second accident, which happened in the past a few days, was more severe. I just found the system has been put into an emergency recovery mode. Still figuring out how to get in the system and recover the data... At the same time, I am moving the site to Azure. That's why the layout of the blog may be a bit weird -- using the backup repo and upgrading to the latest environment is not an easy thing. [IFTTT Delay](https://yage.ai/adding-a-delay-to-ifttt-recipes.html) tool is also up now. If you still cannot connect, please change https back to http. I'm still trying to figure out a solution on how to add back the https without showing the annoying warning of suspicious certificate... Sorry for the inconvenience!
