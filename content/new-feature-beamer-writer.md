Title: New features of Beamer Writer

Finally time for an upgrade of our [Beamer Writer](http://lab.grapeot.me/beamer/). I added two features recently.

* Support for equations. Now when you enter \[x^2\] in the "input" textbox, it will be rendered as it is, i.e.,  \[x^2\] rather than \item \[x^2\] like we did before. This will make inserting equations simpler.
* Support for figures. [[fig2.png]] will be recognized as a figure and be rendered as \\ \medskip { \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{fig2.png} \\ } to provide an image with proper margins. This simplifies the figure insertion.

So, that's it. Enjoy!
