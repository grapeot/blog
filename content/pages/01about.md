Title: About

Hi, welcome to my blog.
Computing and life are the things making me happy.
With building stuffs (yes with coding) as a 20-ish-year-long hobby, I love the feeling to get all shit done and see the damn thing working -- check out the [lab](http://lab.grapeot.me/) page for my demos.
On the other hand, Life is essentially a privilege for all alive humans.
And that's why I'm so curious about the world and enjoy learning.
This blog records some thoughts of me learning various stuffs, like flying an airplane, computer vision, and teching machines to learn too.
Building and learning, this is what this place (and my life) is for.
