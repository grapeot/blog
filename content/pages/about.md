Title: About

Hi, I am Yan Wang, currently a PhD student at Columbia University.
While super interested in thinking about life and building things with programming, I record my thoughts and experience here (That's why it's called Computing Life!).
Hope something will be useful for you too.
At school, my research is about computer vision and machine learning.
And I really wish to push it from papers to reality.
You can check out the [lab](http://lab.grapeot.me/) page for my demos, or leave comments below.
